# Check_GDB_For_Specific_FCs.py

## Overview

The "Check_GDB_For_Specific_FCs.py" script is a Python script developed using ArcPy, a Python library for working with Esri geospatial data, to check a specified geodatabase for user-specified feature classes. The script generates a report listing the found feature classes and those that are missing in the geodatabase. It also incorporates logging and exception handling for better script management and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python and ArcPy**: Ensure you have a Python environment with ArcPy installed. This script is designed to work with Python 2.7 or Python 3.x and ArcGIS Desktop or ArcGIS Pro.

2. **Access to Geodatabase**: You should have access to the geodatabase (GDB) that you want to check for feature classes. Provide the path to the GDB in the script.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download the Script**: Download the "Check_GDB_For_Specific_FCs.py" script to your local machine.

2. **Edit Script Parameters**:

    - Open the script in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
    
    - Modify the following parameters as needed:
    
        - `gdb_path`: Specify the path to your geodatabase (GDB). Replace `'C:\Path\to\your\geodatabase.gdb'` with the actual path.
        
        - `feature_classes_to_search`: Define the list of feature classes you want to search for in the GDB. Replace the sample feature class names with your own.
        
    - Save the script after making the necessary changes.

3. **Run the Script**:

    - Open a command prompt or terminal window.
    
    - Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
    
    - Run the script using Python by entering the following command:
    
        ```
        python CheckGDBForFeatureClasses.py
        ```

4. **Review the Output**:

    - The script will generate a report on the console, listing the found feature classes and those that are missing in the geodatabase.
    
    - A log file named `script_log.txt` will also be created in the script's directory, containing detailed information about the script's execution, including any errors or exceptions.

## Customization

You can customize this script for your specific use case by:

- Modifying the `gdb_path` variable to point to your geodatabase.

- Editing the `feature_classes_to_search` list to specify the feature classes you want to check.

- Adjusting the logging level or output format in the script's logging configuration to suit your needs.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or errors while using the script, please check the following:

- Ensure that you have provided the correct path to the geodatabase in the `gdb_path` variable.

- Verify that the feature class names in the `feature_classes_to_search` list match the actual feature classes in the geodatabase.

- Review the `script_log.txt` log file for detailed information about any errors or exceptions that occurred during script execution.
